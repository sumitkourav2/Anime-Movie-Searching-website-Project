This is an early version of the project, focusing on design and layout, with future plans to incorporate more functionality.

Overview

The Anime Movie Search Website is designed with a user-centric approach, prioritizing ease of use and aesthetic appeal. Users can enter keywords into the search bar to browse through a collection of anime movies, presented in a clean and visually appealing layout. The frontend is fully responsive, ensuring that the website works seamlessly across different devices, from smartphones to desktop computers.

Movie Cards: Search results are displayed as individual cards, each containing basic details like the movie title and a placeholder for further information.

Clean UI/UX: The design is optimized for simplicity and ease of navigation, with a focus on delivering a clutter-free experience.

Custom CSS Styling: The website uses custom CSS for styling, including animations, hover effects, and consistent color schemes tailored for anime fans.
